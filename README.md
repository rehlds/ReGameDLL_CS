Reverse-engineered gamedll (mp.dll / Counter-Strike)

## What is this?
Regamedll_CS is a result of reverse engineering of original library mod HLDS (build 6153beta) using DWARF debug info embedded into linux version of HLDS, cs.so

## Goals of the project
* Provide more stable (than official) version of Counter-Strike game with extended API for mods and plugins

## How can use it?
ReGameDLL_CS is fully compatible with official mod CS 1.6 / CZero by Valve. All you have to do is to download binaries and replace original mp.dll/cs.so

Compiled binaries are available here: [link](http://nexus.rehlds.org/nexus/content/repositories/regamedll-dev/regamedll/regamedll/)

Archive's bin directory contains 2 subdirectories, 'bugfixed' and 'pure'
* 'pure' version is designed to work exactly as official mod CS
* 'bugfixed' version contains some fixes and improvements

<b>Warning!</b> ReGameDLL_CS is not binary compatible with original hlds since it's compiled with compilers other than ones used for original mod CS. This means that plugins that do binary code analysis (Orpheu for example) probably will not work with ReGameDLL_CS.
